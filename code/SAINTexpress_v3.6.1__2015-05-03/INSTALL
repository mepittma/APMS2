Binaries are available for Linux and Windows in the "Precompiled_binaries" directory.


	COMPILING

g++ and gcc version 4.4 or above will be required.

If you are on CentOS 5 or RHEL 5, use the script "CentOS5_RHEL5_build_script.sh" to compile.

On other distributions, use "make -j" to compile.

The binaries are located in the bin/ directory after the compilation finishes.
